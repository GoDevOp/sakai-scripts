If you want to do this on Amazon EC2 and Ubuntu

Pick a ami from this page:
http://uec-images.ubuntu.com/releases/10.04/release/
Matt suggested this ami for me:  ami-3e02f257

Once you have built your instance through Quick Start, 
you will want to open port 8080.  It seems as though
you cannot open anything other than the default ports
during Quick Start.  But you can add port 8080 later
in your EC2 dashboard - go to "Security Groups", select 
the one you use for the instance and you will be able to 
allow 8080 in through that.

Then to connect in, use SSH with the pem file you just 
downloaded.   Here is my ssh command:

ssh -i si791.pem ubuntu@ec2-55-15-154-55.compute-1.amazonaws.com

Once logged in, do the following:

sudo apt-get install subversion
svn co https://source.sakaiproject.org/contrib//csev/trunk/scripts/sakai-full/
cd sakai-full 
bash ubuntu.sh

The ubuntu.sh does a bunch of package installs - just press 'Y'
to get through that.

Then fix your .profile and .bashrc files (just to be safe) with the 
JAVA_OPTS and MAVEN_OPTS from the readme and add:

JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-openjdk ; export JAVA_HOME

Since we just put in a new, JDK

You may want to log out and then log back in to check your
JAVA_HOME, MAVEN_OPTS, and JAVA_OPTS variables are 
properly set.

Then check out all of Sakai:

bash co.sh

Then make a fresh Apache Tomact:

bash na.sh

Then compile all of Sakai:

bash qmv.sh

Then start your Tomcat

cd apache-tomcat-7.0.21
cd logs
rm *
../bin/startup.sh
tail -f catalina.out

When you are done....

../bin/shutdown.sh

Thanks to Matt for his mentoring on this.
