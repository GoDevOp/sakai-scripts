Open the .sql export file from the little open folder icon
You will see the SQL in the Worksheet - press the green
triangle to run the sql and it will bring up a new dialog box
to create a connection.

Then you will press "+" and make a new connection

Username: SYSTEM
Password: oracle
Tick the "Save Password"
Leace the Hostname and port as localhost 1521
Change the SID to orcl
Leave the tick boxes alone.

Press "Save" and then "Connect".

If you want to Import

Then select that connection (likely is already selected) 
and do the import.

Take a look at the tables - you should see them just peachy.

Verify the connection in HenPlus following the 
directions in that readme.
